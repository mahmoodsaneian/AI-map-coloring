# AI Map Coloring

## Overview  
This project implements a **map coloring algorithm** using **Artificial Intelligence** techniques. The goal is to color a given map such that no two adjacent regions (or countries) share the same color, using a minimal number of colors. The algorithm uses various AI strategies, like **backtracking** or **constraint satisfaction**, to efficiently solve the problem.  

## Features  
- **Map Coloring Algorithm**: Solves the map coloring problem by assigning different colors to adjacent regions.  
- **AI Techniques**: Uses backtracking, constraint propagation, or other AI approaches for coloring.  
- **Interactive Visualization**: (If applicable) Displays the map with the applied colors, showing regions in different colors.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python** or **Java** (depending on your implementation)  
- **Artificial Intelligence** concepts like **backtracking**, **constraint satisfaction**  
- **Graph Theory** (for representing regions and their adjacencies)  

## Requirements  
- **Java** or **Python**  
- **IDE** (Optional: IntelliJ, Eclipse for Java or PyCharm for Python)  

## Setup  

### Clone the Repository  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mahmoodsaneian/AI-map-coloring.git
cd AI-map-coloring
```

### How to Run

If the project is written in **Java**:
1. Compile the code:  
   ```sh
   javac Main.java
   ```
2. Run the program:  
   ```sh
   java Main
   ```

If the project is written in **Python**:
1. Install dependencies (if any):  
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the program:  
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

### Input Format  
- The map is represented as a graph, where each region (country) is a node, and the adjacencies between regions are represented as edges between nodes.  
- The input might be provided in the form of a list or matrix, defining the regions and their adjacency relationships.

### Output  
- The program will output a list or a visual representation of the map with regions colored such that no two adjacent regions share the same color.

## Algorithm Details  
- The problem is modeled as a **graph coloring** problem, where the regions are the graph’s nodes, and edges represent adjacency between regions.  
- The goal is to find a coloring assignment such that adjacent nodes have different colors.
- The project may utilize different AI techniques like **backtracking** or **constraint satisfaction** to solve the problem efficiently.
